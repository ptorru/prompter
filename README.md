Simple project for easy use of LLMs hosted by OctoAI.

## Introduction
This project presents a simple chat interface to LLMs hosted by OctoAI.

It also provides a mechanism to store frequenly used prompts for convenient access.

## prompts.json
A JSON file is a text file with a structured format. This structure makes it easy to parse by computer programs.

Our structure is as follows: a simple list of prompts. Each prompt has a few parameters like:
* name: Short name to display in the UI.
* prompt: The actual prompt.
* desctiption: Brief description of what the prompt achieves.
* model: The actual LLM model to be used for this prompt.
